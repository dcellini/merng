# A social media style app (front end and back end)

This is a social media like app with the ability to add posts.
It contains a login/register system and the ability to like and comment on posts.

This is the combined app (client and server) which will work locally.

To run the Front End
Navigate to the client folder and run `yarn start`

To run the Back End
In the main folder run `yarn start`.
If there are errors it may be due to the fact the data is housed in https://cloud.mongodb.com/ and if the project has not been activated for a while there is a need to login and connect again.
